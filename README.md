# add-collaborator [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/add-collaborator.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/add-collaborator)

> Add a collaborator to all of your github repositories.

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i add-collaborator -g
```

## Usage

Pull down repositories.

```sh
$ add-collaborator repos
```

Sync collaborators with repositories

```sh
$ add-collaborator sync
```

Do both at once

```sh
$ add-collaborator repos sync
```

Force questions for github authentication and settings to be asked again

```sh
$ add-collaborator repos sync -f
```

Provide flags through the commandline to override stored settings.

* `user` or `u` for github user that is the owner of the repositories
* `collaborator` or `c` for the collaborator to add
* `token` or `t` for github authentication token (basic github authentication is not supported through flags)

```sh
$ add-collaborator repos sync -u [username] -c [collaborator] -t [token]
```
